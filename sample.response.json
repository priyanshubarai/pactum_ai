                "severity": "high",
                "title": "Undefined Project Specifications",
                "explanation": "Clause 1 states that 'exact specifications and features will be mutually decided during the course of the project.' This lack of upfront clarity on deliverables creates significant risk for scope creep and potential disputes over what is included in the agreed fee, making it difficult to determine completion.",
                "suggestion": "Amend Clause 1 to require a detailed Statement of Work (SOW) or a comprehensive project brief to be appended to the agreement, outlining all deliverables, features, and specifications before project commencement.",
                "clauseSnippet": "The exact specifications and features will be mutually decided during the course of the project."

                "title": "One-Sided Delay Clause",
                "explanation": "Clause 2 states 'Delays caused by the Freelancer will not be tolerated' without defining the consequences or acknowledging potential delays caused by the Client (e.g., slow feedback, late content). This is an unbalanced term that unfairly places all timeline risk on the Freelancer.",
                "suggestion": "Revise Clause 2 to define consequences for freelancer delays and include reciprocal provisions for client-caused delays, potentially extending the project timeline or incurring additional costs.",
                "clauseSnippet": "Delays caused by the Freelancer will not be tolerated."

                "title": "Vague Payment Conditions",
                "explanation": "Clause 3 states the 'remaining balance shall be paid upon project completion' and 'within a reasonable time.' Neither 'project completion' nor 'reasonable time' is clearly defined, creating significant ambiguity about when the final payment is due and what constitutes satisfactory completion.",
                "suggestion": "Amend Clause 3 to clearly define 'project completion' (e.g., Client's written acceptance of final deliverables) and specify a fixed payment term (e.g., 'within 15 business days of invoice submission').",
                "clauseSnippet": "The remaining balance shall be paid upon project completion / Payment shall be made via bank transfer within a reasonable time."

                "title": "Unclear Revision Scope",
                "explanation": "Clause 4 states the Client is entitled to 'request revisions' and the Freelancer will 'implement all reasonable changes.' The number of included revisions, what constitutes 'reasonable,' and whether extensive changes might incur additional costs or affect the timeline, are not defined, leading to potential scope disputes.",
                "suggestion": "Specify the number of included revision rounds, define the scope of revisions (e.g., minor adjustments, not new features), and outline a process for handling change requests that fall outside the initial scope, including potential additional fees and timeline adjustments.",
                "clauseSnippet": "The Client is entitled to request revisions during the project lifecycle. The Freelancer agrees to implement all reasonable changes requested by the Client."

                "title": "Broad and One-Sided Confidentiality Clause",
                "explanation": "Clause 6 broadly states the Freelancer must keep 'all Client information confidential' without defining what constitutes confidential information, specifying exclusions (e.g., public domain information, legally compelled disclosures), or imposing reciprocal obligations on the Client regarding Freelancer's information.",
                "suggestion": "Define 'Confidential Information' more precisely, include standard exclusions (e.g., information publicly available, independently developed), and consider adding a reciprocal confidentiality obligation for the Client if the Freelancer shares any proprietary information.",
                "clauseSnippet": "The Freelancer agrees to keep all Client information confidential during and after the term of this Agreement."

                "title": "Vague and Unfair Termination Terms",
                "explanation": "Clause 7 allows the Client to terminate if 'unsatisfied with the Freelancer’s performance' without defining criteria for dissatisfaction or allowing for a cure period. Crucially, 'payment obligations will be decided fairly' is extremely vague and creates high risk for disputes, as 'fairly' is subjective and undefined. There is no provision for the Freelancer to terminate.",
                "suggestion": "Revise Clause 7 to define specific grounds for termination (e.g., material breach with a cure period), outline clear payment obligations upon termination (e.g., pro-rata payment for work completed), and include provisions for termination by either party for convenience with appropriate notice periods and payment terms.",
                "clauseSnippet": "The Client may terminate this Agreement at any time if unsatisfied with the Freelancer’s performance. In the event of termination, payment obligations will be decided fairly."

                "explanation": "Clause 8 only addresses indirect damages ('The Freelancer shall not be held responsible for any indirect damages'). It fails to mention direct damages, establish a cap on overall liability, or include indemnification provisions, leaving significant liability aspects unaddressed for both parties.",
                "suggestion": "Expand Clause 8 to include provisions for direct damages, a clear cap on the Freelancer's total liability, and mutual indemnification clauses for issues like IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
                "clauseSnippet": "The Freelancer shall not be held responsible for any indirect damages arising from the use of the delivered work."
